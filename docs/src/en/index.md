# IOT Calendar

[Docker Hub container](https://hub.docker.com/r/andgineer/iot-calendar)
that generates image for Amazon Kindle.

![calendar](images/calendar.png)
See [description in my blog](https://sorokin.engineer/posts/en/iot_calendar_synology.html).

The image contains calendar with events from Google Calendar - supposedly events from your IoT
(like [Smart wifi button (Amazon Dash Button hack)](https://sorokin.engineer/posts/en/amazon_dash_button_hack.html)).

Also it has html-page that updates the image every minute (link to
this page in index.html).
